**Project Title: Building a Secure E-commerce Recommendation Engine with Differential Privacy**

**Project Overview:**
This project addresses a critical challenge in e-commerce: balancing recommendation personalization with user privacy. You'll develop a recommendation engine that leverages differential privacy, a sophisticated technique to protect user data while maintaining recommendation accuracy.

**Technical Components:**
- **Recommendation Engine Framework:** Choose a framework like Apache Spark's MLlib or TensorFlow. These offer functionalities for building and deploying recommendation systems.
- **Differential Privacy Library:** Utilize libraries like OpenDP (Python) or Dapple (Java) to implement differential privacy techniques. These libraries provide algorithms for adding noise to data while preserving its utility for training models.
- **E-commerce Dataset:** You can find publicly available e-commerce datasets (e.g., Amazon MovieLens) or create a synthetic dataset that reflects Flipkart's product categories and user interactions.

**Project Implementation:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the e-commerce dataset, ensuring data quality and addressing potential biases.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from user interactions and product information to build a robust recommendation model.
3. **Recommendation Algorithm:** Select a collaborative filtering algorithm (e.g., Matrix Factorization) for generating recommendations.
4. **Differential Privacy Integration:** Apply differential privacy techniques like Laplace Mechanism or Gaussian Mechanism to inject controlled noise into user data before training the recommendation model. This helps protect user privacy but introduces some trade-offs in recommendation accuracy.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train the recommendation model using the differentially private data and evaluate its performance on metrics like precision, recall, and recommendation diversity.
6. **Deployment and Scalability:** Consider deploying the model as a microservice or API using technologies like Docker or Kubernetes. This enables integration with Flipkart's existing e-commerce platform.
